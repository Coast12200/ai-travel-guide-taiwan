I'll help you optimize and clean up the code. Let me first explore the project structure to understand what needs to be cleaned up.

*Listed directory [ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main - v9](file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main%20-%20v9) *

*Searched filesystem*

### Planner Response

I can see there are duplicate files that need to be cleaned up:
- `index copy.html` (duplicate of [index.html](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main%20-%20v9/index.html:0:0-0:0))
- [js\ui copy.js](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main%20-%20v9/js/ui%20copy.js:0:0-0:0) (duplicate of [js\ui.js](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main%20-%20v9/js/ui.js:0:0-0:0))

Let me check if there are any other issues and create a comprehensive cleanup plan.

Now I have a good understanding of the project structure. Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan for code cleanup and optimization.

Now let me verify that the files I plan to delete are not referenced anywhere before requesting user approval.

Perfect! The verification shows:
- `index copy.html` - No references found (safe to delete)
- `ui copy.js` - No references found (safe to delete)
- [example-usage.js](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/ai-travel-guide-taiwan-main%20-%20v9/js/example-usage.js:0:0-0:0) - Only self-references in comments (safe to delete)

Now I'll request user approval for the cleanup plan.
